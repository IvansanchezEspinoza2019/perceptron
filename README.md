# Perceptron

The perceptron algorithm was invented in 1958 at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory by Frank Rosenblatt. This algorithm is used to train the neuronal model created by McCulloch-Pitts.

It is an algorithm used for supervised learning of binary classifiers. Binary classifiers decide whether an input, usually represented by a series of vectors, belongs to a specific class. In short, a perceptron is a single-layer neural network. They consist of four main parts including input values (X), weights (W) and bias (B), net sum (Weight sum), and an activation function (Decides to which class belongs each input).
